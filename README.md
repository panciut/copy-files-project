# Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive structure for managing various components of a backend system, including controllers, routes, types, models, and services. It includes scripts to copy files into a single markdown file and generate a directory tree from a specified base path.

## Directory Structure

The project follows a modular approach with clearly defined directories for different components:

- `controllers`: Contains logic to handle incoming requests and responses.
- `routes`: Defines the endpoints and maps them to corresponding controllers.
- `types`: Contains TypeScript type definitions.
- `models`: Manages data structures and interactions with the database.
- `services`: Contains business logic and utility functions.
- `config`: Configuration files for the project.
- `utils`: Utility functions for various tasks.

## Scripts

### Copy Files Script

This script copies the contents of specified files into a single markdown file. It categorizes the paths into controllers, routes, types, models, and services, then copies each category into separate markdown files.

#### Usage

To use the script, run:

```bash
node copyFiles.js
```

#### Example Output

- `all.md`: Contains all the files.
- `controllers.md`: Contains only the controller files.
- `routes.md`: Contains only the route files.
- `types.md`: Contains only the type files.
- `models.md`: Contains only the model files.
- `rest.md`: Contains the remaining files.
- `services.md`: Contains only the service files.
- `categorized.md`: Contains all categorized files.
- `typesAndModels.md`: Contains both type and model files.

### Directory Tree Script

This script generates a directory tree from a specified base path and writes the tree structure to a markdown file. It can also generate a tree based on a list of file paths.

#### Usage

To use the script, run:

```bash
node generateTree.js
```

#### Example Output

- `tree.md`: Directory tree of the entire project.
- `treeSrc.md`: Directory tree of the `src` folder.
- `treePaths.md`: Directory tree generated from the specified file paths.

## Configuration

The base path and source paths are configured in the `backend_polyglot.js` file. Adjust these paths as needed to match your project's structure.
